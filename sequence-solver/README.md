Sequence Solver

The idea is to create a program that, given an arithmetic sequence computed 
from a polynomial will dedude the polynomial, and thus can compute any 
element in that sequence.

For example, the following sequence:
0, 4, 18, 48, 100, ...
is generated from the polynomial p(n) = n^3 - n^2

The program should take terms of the sequence as inputs and compute the
polynomial itself
